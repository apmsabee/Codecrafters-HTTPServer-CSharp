# C# HTTP Server
Implemented following the steps outlined on Codecrafters - not through copying code, but through step-by-step implementation and testing. 

Implemented the basics of an HTTP server while learning about TCP Protocols. Server can respond with the correct response type given a certain input (200, 404, 201, 500), can support concurrent connections, read a request header and body, return a file, extract a URL path from a request and respond appropriately depending on the path, and supports gzip compression while being able to parse multiple compression schemas in the input.
